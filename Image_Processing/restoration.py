    The best-known order-statistic filter in image processing is the median filter, which, as its name implies, replaces
    the value of a pixel by the median of the intensity levels in a predefined neighborhood of that pixel. The value of
    the pixel is included in the computation of the median.

    Median filters are quite popular because, for certain types of random noise, they provide excellent noise-reduction
    capabilities, with considerably less blurring than linear smoothing filters of similar size. Median filters are
    particularly effective in the presence of both bipolar and unipolar impulse noise.

    :param image: The image for filtering.
    :param padding_type: Padding type used for applying the filter.
    :param filter_size: The filter size used for the image restoration.

    :return: Filtered image.
