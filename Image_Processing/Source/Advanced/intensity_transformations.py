Script Name - intensity_transformations.py

Purpose - Perform intensity transformations on an image. Intensity transformations refer to changes per pixel (as
opposed to pixel neighbourhood operations).

Best practice for working with intensity transformations (*):
    1) Construct a formula for the transformation dependent on the pixel value - T(pixel).
    2) Prepare a lookup table for all the possible pixel values (see use_lookup_table method docstring for time
       analysis).
    3) Use the lookup table to transform the image.

(*) - Assuming the image intensity values are integers.

    When looking at reconstructed images, it is noticeable that when dropping a few bits (2-3), the image quality
    remains intact (identical to human eyes). This means that the human eye, can't detect differences up to a change of
    4-8 pixel value colors. In terms of engineering, this could help with compression, as lower bits can be dropped

    Since an image is normally continuous (other than edges), the difference between MSB values of neighbouring pixels
    is small. Therefore, when slicing significant bits, the pixel values should give a relatively 'good' image, where
    the object is recognizable (*).
    This is not the case for the less significant bits as even small changes in pixel values, drastically changes those
